    <p>Sponsoring PyCon UK is a great way for your company to support the Python community, promote your products to more than seven hundred delegates, and meet Python developers who are looking for work.</p>

    <p>We couldn't run the conference without the generous support of our sponsors.</p>
    <p>In return, we will ensure that your company is given exposure before, during, and after the conference, and we will work with you so that you get exactly what you're looking for out of sponsoring the conference.</p>

<h2>Sponsorship benefits</h2>
<p>We will promote sponsors before the conference through social media and in the <a href="http://uk.python.org/" rel="nofollow">UK Python News</a> newsletter. In addition, your logo will be placed on the conference website and on signs around the conference venue.</p>
<p>Sponsors receive free tickets for the duration of the conference.</p>
<p>For Silver and higher levels, your company will be able to set up a booth in the central <a href="http://www.cardiffcityhall.com/rooms/marble-hall" rel="nofollow">Marble Hall</a> to allow you to interact with attendees for the duration of the conference.</p>
<p>We run a jobs fair over the Sunday lunchtime, allowing sponsors to meet conference attendees who are (or expect to be soon) looking for work.</p>
